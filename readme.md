# What is this?
- I used to have various config files scattered across different repos, which worked, but had some pain points. In particular it required pulling various repos into different locations when setting up a new machine. I'd like to streamline that process.
- Install GNU stow, pull this repo into your home directory, and call `stow .` to set up symlinks in appropriate places to the config files saved here.
